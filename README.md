# sosoBilibiliDanmakuHime
## Discription
Another bilibili danmaku reader.

In 2016, I got an android apk which can connect to bilibili live room, and got the danmaku (floating comment text). By that time, I have already wrote a c# plugin for danmuji.org, and I assume it should not be quite difficult to write another one on Android.

I was wrong.

After 2 years of waiting, fight for the bull$hit Android Studio and so called gardle, I made it work as I wished finally.

## Usage
You should at lease have one TTS engine installed on your phone.</br>
And if you're using MIUI, you may have to look up this app in battery setting to avoid being killed when the screen is off.
